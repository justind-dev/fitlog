# FitLog

CLI workout tracker for people who prefer pen and paper in the gym but want data analysis later.

## Usage

```bash
python fitlog.py

## Important Notes

Exercise names must be consistent for proper analysis. The app treats "barbell curls", "bb curls", and "bb curl" as three different exercises. Use the same naming convention each time you log an exercise.

- Weight/reps input parsing
- Auto unit detection (lbs/kg)

## Planned Features
